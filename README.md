# SudokuSolver
Developed a web-based Sudoku solver utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application leverages the backtracking algorithm, a powerful technique for solving constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku. Users can input puzzles, and the solver utilizes an external API (if applicable) to retrieve the solution. The application effectively displays both the puzzle and the solved state, providing a user-friendly interface.
