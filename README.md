# SudokuSolver
Developed a web-based Sudoku solver utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application leverages the backtracking algorithm, a powerful technique for solving constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku. Users can input puzzles, and the solver utilizes an external API (if applicable) to retrieve the solution. The application effectively displays both the puzzle and the solved state, providing a user-friendly interface. 


Front-End Development: Learned to build interactive web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, effectively structuring the Sudoku grid and providing visual feedback.
Backtracking Algorithm: Gained experience in applying backtracking to solve constraint satisfaction problems, implementing logical checks and decision-making within the algorithm.
(Optional) API Integration: Explored the process of selecting, interacting with, and handling data from external APIs, enriching the functionality of the application.
